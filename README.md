rolne
=====

**rolne** is a python library for the *rolne* data type. The name *rolne* is an acronym: **R** ecursive **O** rdered **L** ists of **N** amed **E** lements

rolne's are used as an easy means to use open-ended data; such as seen in serializations like XML and MARDS. It is *not* itself a serialization. It is strictly an organized way of handling the data once imported.

Documentation is to be found at [readthedocs.org] (http://rolne.readthedocs.org/).
