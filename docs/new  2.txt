Let's use it for example questions:


What is the id of note #2?

>>> my_xml["messages"]["note", None, 1]["id"].value

What notes were sent from "Jani"?

>>> my_xml.search(["messages", "note"], from="Jani")

Who were they sent to?

>>> my_xml.search(["messages", "note"], from="Jani").list_values("to")
["Tove"]
